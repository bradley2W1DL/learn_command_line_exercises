The * (asterisk) allows you to specify more than one file at a time.

Alternative "english" ways of using the asterisk:

>How big are is foo.txt?

Not exactly sure what is meant here but, `ls -l foo.txt` will show the size of the file.  <br/>
It will be listed in bytes just before the date that the file was last modified.

>Can you output all the txt files in this directory?

no problem: `cat *.txt`

>Show me the content of the text files in slash temp.

ok: `cat /tmp/*.txt`
