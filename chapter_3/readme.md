###As you'll learn in this chapter, hostname (print computer's hostname)<br/> shows you what computer you are running commands on.<br/>
##Alternative "english" ways of asking for your hostname:<br/>
>What host are you on?

type `hostname` into the terminal, which will then display the host you are on. <br/>
In other words, it will display the name of your computer.

>Are you on your local machine?

type `hostname` into the terminal.  If it prints <computer name>.local, then yes, you are on your local machine <br/>
For example: when I type `hostname` the terminal prints `Bradleys-MacBook-Air.local`
