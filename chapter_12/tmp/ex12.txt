“A day of dappled seaborne clouds.

The phrase and the day and the scene harmonised in a chord. Words. Was it their colours? He allowed them to glow and
fade, hue after hue: sunrise gold, the russet and green of apple orchards, azure of waves, the greyfringed fleece of
clouds. No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and balance of the period itself. Did he then love the
rhythmic rise and fall of words better than their associations of legend and colour? Or was it that, being as weak of
sight as he was shy of mind, he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing sensible world through the prism
of a language manycoloured and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner world of individual emotions
mirrored perfectly in a lucid supple periodic prose?”
