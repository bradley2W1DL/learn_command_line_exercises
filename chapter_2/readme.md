#Alternative "english" ways of asking for your working directory:

> 1) What directory are you in?

··· Type `pwd` into terminal, and it will print working directory. I.e. the directory that you're in.



> 2) Are you in the class directory?

··· Type `pwd`, if the terminal displays: `/Users/bird/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015` then, yes, you are in the class directory.

> 3) Are you in your home directory?

··· type in `pwd`, if that displays `Users/<username>`   (`Users/bird` in my case) then you are in fact in the home directory<br/>
The home directory is also designated by the `~` character.

> 4) What directory did you run that command in?

··· Type `pwd` into the terminal and it will print out the directory you are currently in.  
Meaning that it is also the directory in which you ran the previous command. <br/>


unless of course that command was `cd` in which case `pwd` will print whichever directory you moved to.
