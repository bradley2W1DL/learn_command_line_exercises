The * (asterisk) allows you to specify more than one file at a time.

Alternative "english" ways of using the asterisk:

>How big are is foo.txt?

you could see by typing: `ls -l foo.txt` the size of the file will be listed in bytes just before the date.

>Can you output all the txt files in this directory?

no problem: `cat *.txt`

>Show me the content of the text files in slash temp.

ok: `cat /tmp/*.txt`
