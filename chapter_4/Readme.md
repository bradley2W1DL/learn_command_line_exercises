###Alternative "english" ways of asking you to create a directory:

>Can you make a temp directory?

ans: Yes you can. <br/>
In the terminal just type `mkdir tmp` and it will create a directory named 'tmp' in whatever folder you're currently in (the `pwd`)

>Can you make a log directory in your class directory?

To do this, first check to see what directory you're in using `pwd` <br/>
If you are already in the class directory simply type `mkdir log`, and the directory will be created <br/>
If you are not in the class directory, you must first navigate to it: <br/>
type: `cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015` <br/>
Now you can create the log directory using `mkdir log`<br/>
<br/>
**alternately** you can just create the 'log' directory in the class folder from wherever if you type: <br/>
`mkdir ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/log`
