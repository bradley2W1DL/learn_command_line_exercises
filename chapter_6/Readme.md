>What does the command `ls -lR` show us?

The `ls -lR` command shows us all of the files and directories within a directory in the long listing format recursively. <br/>
The 'recursively' part mean that the `ls -l` command is then repeated in each directory within the parent directory, thereby <br/>
displaying the long listing format for each file within all subsequent child directories.

<br/>
Alternative "english" ways of asking for a list of files:<br/>

>What's in the tmp directory?

lets find out; type: `ls tmp` <br/>
my terminal output:<br/>
`iamcool.txt` *naturally* <br/>
and it should be noted that my `pwd` here is: ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises

>Can you show me what files are in that directory?

sure thing: `ls "that directory"` will list for you all the files in 'that directory'.

>What files are in your home directory?

type: `ls ~` <br/>
this displays all the files and directories within my home directory...<br/>

>What's in slash temp?

The command to run in order to find that out is: `ls /tmp` <br/>
this lists everything in the /tmp directory; which for me is... <br/>

###Comments

I do have a question regarding the specifics of what is displayed in the 'long listing format' <br/>
For example, if I call `ls -l ~/workspace/` the terminal returns: <br/>
total 0 <br/>

I'm still not 100% sure what the `drwxr-xr-x@  6 bird  staff  204` means -- so I guess I'll look into that; and write a blog post about it. <br/>
